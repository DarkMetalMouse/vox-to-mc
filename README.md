# vox-to-mc

Usage: 
In `vox-to-schematic.py` change `INPUT_FILE` and `OUTPUT FILE` to your desired locations
Then run `python vox-to-schematic.py`
During runtime, you will be asked to supply a block to correspond with each color, the format there is the minecraft id of the block (e.g. 'iron_block')
If you want to run multiple iterations and keep your colors, at the end of the program values in `{}` will be printed, you can paste those into the `colors` variable

The code works using [my fork](https://github.com/DarkMetalMouse/py-vox-io) of py-vox-io. install it via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
